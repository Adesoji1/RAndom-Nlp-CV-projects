    This script uses the flask and tensorflow libraries to create a RESTful API that uses an attention mechanism for natural language processing. The API receives text input via an HTTP POST request and returns a prediction as a JSON object. The attention mechanism is applied to the input sequence to help the model better understand the relationships between words in the text.
