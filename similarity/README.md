To create a RESTful API for a similarity check in Python, you can use the Flask web framework. Flask is a lightweight framework that makes it easy to create web applications in Python. Here is an example of how you might implement a simple RESTful API for a similarity check using Flask:
To test this API, you can send a POST request to the /similarity endpoint with a JSON payload that includes the two texts you want to compare. For example, you could use the following Python code to send a request:
This should print the cosine similarity between the two texts. You can modify the code to compute other measures of similarity or to implement more advanced functionality as needed.
