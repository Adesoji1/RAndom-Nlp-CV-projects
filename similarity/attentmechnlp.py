"""
Build a Text Classification Model with Attention Mechanism NLP

This script uses the tensorflow and tensorflow_datasets libraries to build a text classification model with an attention mechanism. The model is trained on the IMDB Reviews dataset and then evaluated on the test set. The attention mechanism is applied to the input sequence, which helps the model to better understand the relationships between words in the input text.
